----------------------------------Project Overview----------------------------------
This project is a self made Tic Tac Toe board complete with both starting ways for
single player chess as well as a local PvP mode. In addition there is an easter egg,
more specifically a reference to the movie 'War Games'

--------------------------------Installation and Setup--------------------------------
All that is needed to run this file is ensure that you have tkinter, pandas, random, and time
installed, then run either 'main' file. I recommend the 'main' within the
For_If_Pandas_Classes_and_Files_are_Required folder as that has some extra features
and the better documented code.

----------------------------------Usage Guide----------------------------------
After running the main file for whichever version of the code you wish to play
a menu will appear. Use this to choose from singleplayer, pvp, exiting the game,
or the aforementioned easter egg. If you select the easter egg, simply press the
button on the middle right, which toggles two opposing AI that play optimal moves
(after the very first move is randomly selected). If you enter local pvp you will
be shown a tic tac toe board and an exit button, as well as a save and load button.
The save and load buttons each respectively save and load the current wins for each
player, and the ties for each player. X will play first, and to make a move simply
click where you wish to place your tile. If you selected singleplayer another menu
will appear, which asks if you want to move first or let the bot move and play your
move second, simply click the button that you prefer to play. Once either button is
player a screen will show up with an exit button and the 9 tiles that make up the board.
Simply click on an open tile to move and the bot will move in response. Be aware that
the bot is not very good, so if you want a much harder challenge, try to tie the bot,
without letting it win or lose.

----------------------------------Testing instructions----------------------------------
You can test the code by doing it? I don't really get what to put here.

For the code from the min/max algorithm I based it off of divyesh072019's code for
the same thing, albeit with minor adjustments to get it to mesh with my code.
